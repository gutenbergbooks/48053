I first became aware of the high artistic merit of Paul
Bartlett's work on the classic haciendas of Old Mexico when
I came upon an exhibition in Texas in 1968.  His
drawings, sketches, and photographs evoked so effectively
the historic buildings I had known when working in Mexico
that I wrote to the architect-artist to inform him
of my pleasure.
</p>

<p><p class="noindent">
Subsequently, I saw examples of his devotion to the great
haciendas with their strong Mexican-Spanish coloration, and
always I enjoyed his reminders of what life in
colonial Mexico must have been like for the favored classes.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is rewarding to renew my acquaintance with this
remarkable body of work, for it is a reassuring example of
what a lifetime of scholarship can accomplish.

<h3>
Preface
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The haciendas of Mexico have a special appeal for me.  They
represent a way of life that is now gone&mdash;some would say
fortunately, since it was often a burdensome
and cruel way of life for the peasant workers, a way of
life that eventually motivated a revolution and the
dissolution of the majority of hacienda landholdings.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Many haciendas can be reached only with difficulty by horse
or by foot, by boat or motorcycle or jeep.  Their isolation
from the culture of Europe, three hundred years
ago, impresses the mind with its severity.  In their
isolation, these estates recall the brave attempts of
hacienda families to re-establish cultivated patterns of
living in the
New World, with fine china and crystal, grand pianos and
chapel organs, ornate furnishings, paintings, and
tapestries.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
For my project, I received no financial rewards.  Hence, I
made repeated trips to Mexico, each funded by the modest
savings accumulated in the United States
between visits, with the hacienda project ever in mind.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
My wife, Elizabeth encouraged my efforts.  She was my
mainstay, my constant friend and faithful companion.  Our son,
Steven, was born in Mexico and was raised in a
world punctuated by hacienda visits; he was my <i>compañero</i> on
many hacienda trips.  The three of us usually returned to
Mexico to stay for a year or two at a time.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To find out where haciendas were located in a particular
area, I turned to local government officials, owners of
village stores, the postman, or the peasant who
delivered charcoal on his burro.  Mostly, I found
the haciendas on random trips, when their archways and
rooftops appeared in the distance.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In 1941, when I began this project, few studies of the
Mexican hacienda had been made.  Only a handful of scholars
had visited individual haciendas, and had gained
first-hand familiarity with a limited number of them.  To
this day, with the possible exception of my own work, this
is still true.  And it is certain to remain true, since
many of the haciendas I visited no longer exist.  My own
interest in that heritage was to re-create the special aura
that my visits to more than three hundred haciendas
had created.  As an artist I felt an enduring affinity with
a time that is no more, a heritage and tradition that may
be recaptured only, I think, through the medium of art.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This, then, is an attempt to survey the story of the
haciendas.  It is not a treatise about their economic
structure, their political influence, or their historical
importance in
the establishment of New Spain.  Despite the meager records
relating to the many individual haciendas, there are
excellent studies of regional haciendas in Mexico.  The
reader will find references to them in the Bibliography.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The text was written to accompany a selection of my
hacienda illustrations, including descriptions of hacienda
life based on information received from personal
contacts with hacienda families and caretakers who could
still recall the old days.  My impressions and commentary
are offered to enable the reader to leave the
twentieth century for a while and return to a period when
the freshly colonized American continent witnessed the
birth, the spread, and eventually the death of a unique
way of life.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Finally, I wish to acknowledge my thanks to the many who
helped my hacienda project to develop and grow through its
many stages; among them: historians Frank
Tannenbaum of Columbia University and Silvio Zavala of
Mexico City; authors Ralph Roeder, Stuart Chase, and
Russell Kirk; artist Roberto Montenegro; art
directors Reginald Poland of
the Atlanta Art Association, Herbert Friedmann of the Los
Angeles County Museum, Donald Goodall of the University of
Texas Art Gallery in Austin, the Reverend
J. Pociask, S.J. of the DeSaisset Gallery at the University of
Santa Clara, and Stella Benson of the Latin American
library collections at the University of Texas in Austin;
and art patron Huntington Hartford.  I am especially
grateful to my son, Steven, without whose help this book
would have remained an unfinished project.  I am also
indebted to Dr. Fae Batten for her magnanimous effort,
patience, and skill in preparing my photos for this book,
and to Lowell Waxman, head librarian of the
Claremont Branch of the San Diego Libraries for his
tireless assistance in the department of references.  In
addition, I am thankful for the good friends and associates it
has been my fortune to come across on the long journey over
the years.

</p>

<p class="noindent">
The lifework of artist Paul Alexander Bartlett to retrieve
the past of the Mexican hacienda has made this book
possible.  This volume contains a selection of his original
pen-and-ink illustrations and photographs, realized over a
period of some forty years, of more than three hundred
haciendas.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bartlett began his record during the 1940s.  He made a
series of visits to Mexico to sketch and photograph the
hacienda buildings that had survived the Agrarian
Reform.  Many haciendas were inaccessibly located, at
considerable distances from population centers.  He traveled
hundreds of miles on foot, on muleback, by train
and by boat, climbed hills, and descended into canyons to
find them.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The record that Bartlett has made represents an important
chapter in Mexican history.  Because the majority of
hacienda structures have been subjected to severe and
progressive deterioration, his study, in many cases, is the
only trace that remains of the physical appearance of
individual haciendas.  His collection of illustrations and
photographs is now in the custody of two institutions, the
University of Texas at Austin, in
the Benson Latin American Collection, and the University of
Wyoming in Laramie, in the Western History Research Center
[Now the American Heritage Center].
These two archives will be useful to
scholars interested in the physical structure of the
haciendas, their evolution and history, their economy, as
well as in comparative studies.  At the same time, this
collection of materials makes it possible to study the
characteristics of different types of haciendas.  Above all,
the contents of the two archives form an extremely
valuable resource for the history of art and architecture.

<p class="noindent">
When Bartlett began his travels through the Mexican
backcountry, the producing haciendas had largely
disappeared.  What he found were often remnants of an
earlier
existence during the Porfiriato, the period between 1877
and 1911.  Many of the buildings he saw dated from this
epoch, along with their interior decorations, water
and irrigation systems, machinery, and farming tools.  In
addition to these haciendas, he also found vestiges of the
first half of
the nineteenth century and of the colonial era.  These were
mainly hacienda buildings, some of which had been rebuilt
during the Porfiriato.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The disintegration of the haciendas began as a result of
the Mexican Revolution, and it ended with the
redistribution of their land during the Agrarian Reform.
During
the 1930s and 1940s, huge rural estates were fragmented and
converted into <i>ejidos</i> or <i>minifundios</i>.  <i>Ejidos</i> are tracts of
land that are granted as communal property
to rural towns.  They are worked by members of the community,
who benefit from the land's yield.  Ejidal properties cannot
be sold or transferred.  The <i>minifundios</i>
are small private pieces of property, amounting on the
average to 100 hectares but varying according to the region
of the country and type of soil.  Between 1934 and
1940, approximately 17,900,000 hectares (44,230,900 acres)
were redistributed, representing close to half of all
tillable land.  This repartitioning of the land has
continued into the present, though its pace has been much
slower.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As hacienda property was broken up, the hacienda owners,
the <i>hacendados</i>, were left in possession of the hacienda
buildings and the immediate land around them,
the size of which was restricted by the limits that were
set for these small properties.  This meant that immense
haciendas were reduced to very tiny ranches.  Along with
their land, the hacendados lost access to water, they lost
their means of irrigation, machinery, and livestock.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Because of these measures, the hacienda system was
annihilated.  For the majority of the hacendados, the few
acres left them turned out to be unproductive land, and
their hardships were magnified by the instability and the
violence that prevailed in the country.  As a result, many
hacienda buildings were abandoned or were destined
for new purposes.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Only a few of the ex-haciendas remained in production.  Some
landowners took advantage of the limited property left to
them to plant lucrative, high-yielding crops,
while others augmented the size of their
cultivated land by leasing adjoining land or by purchasing
it under assumed names.

<p class="noindent">
When Bartlett began his hacienda visits in the 1940s, he
found many of the hacienda buildings in ruins, exposed to
the ravages of time and vandalism.  Buildings had
been converted into chicken coops, pigsties, public
apartments, and machine shops.  Others served as sources for
construction materials, from which were scavenged
rocks, bricks, beams, and tiles for the habitations of the
local population.  In some cases the destruction was total:
All the hacienda's structures were removed, and only
the name of the place alluded to the fact that an hacienda
had ever existed there.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
At other haciendas, buildings were adapted to new uses.
They were transformed into hotels, resorts, government
buildings, barracks, hospitals, restaurants, and
schools.  The exterior of the buildings were generally left
intact; interiors were completely changed.

<p class="noindent">
The best-preserved hacienda buildings were those that
continued to function as country properties or vacation
homes.  In these, Bartlett often found furnishings and
utensils from the epoch of Don Porfirio, surrounded by the
old traditions of Mexican country life.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As an artist, Bartlett's attention was drawn foremost to
the hacienda buildings themselves and to the works of art
that they housed.  The majority of his illustrations and
photographs therefore depict the main group of hacienda
buildings or certain buildings&mdash;for example, the main
residence, the church, the patios, and work buildings.
However, among his rich materials, one can also find a
testimony to hacienda work and life: machinery, irrigation
devices and structures, farm implements, mining
equipment, warehouses, barns, corrals, and carriages, among
others.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The history of the hacienda spans three centuries.  The
first haciendas appeared in New Spain toward the beginning
of the seventeenth century, when demand for
agricultural products increased and the prehispanic supply
system crumbled.  Farming received an impetus at the hands
of Spaniards, and the small farms and livestock
ranches, which dated from the sixteenth century, expanded
their landholdings.  Many new sources of water were tapped,
and a resident labor force was developed.
These steps encouraged production and supplied the regional
as well as the continually growing metropolitan markets.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The increase in hacienda production and in the number of
hacienda workers made it necessary to expand the
sixteenth-century facilities, which, with the exception of
those of the sugar plantations, had been very modest.  In
this way, a large number of buildings were constructed,
buildings that were to be preserved as the core of
many haciendas until the Porfiriato.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There were three principal types of haciendas.  Grain
haciendas were the most important because they were
dedicated to the cultivation of the subsistence crops corn
and wheat.  In addition, beans, barley, lima beans, chiles,
and other crops were planted.  Grain haciendas were
established mainly in the vicinity of the urban centers,
which they supplied.  The important areas of grain
cultivation were Puebla, Atlixco, Toluca, Guadalajara, Oaxaca,
and Michoacán.  Livestock haciendas occupied a second level
of importance.  They raised cattle and horses, as well as
goats and sheep.  This type of hacienda tended
to be located in more remote areas, in an attempt to
prevent the livestock from invading cultivated fields.
Sugar haciendas were located in tropical regions, where they
could count on sufficient water for the cultivation of
sugarcane.  The most important sugar regions were Veracruz,
Cuernavaca, Cuautla, and Michoacán.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Throughout the seventeenth century the haciendas grew in
significance.  They held much of the land and water
resources, expanded their labor force, intensified their
control over the market, and consolidated their territorial
rights in accordance with <i>composiciones de tierras</i>.  (The
phrase <i>composiciones de tierras</i> belongs to the
legal terminology of the time.  It relates to a legal
mechanism that was instituted by the Spanish Crown during
the first half of the sixteenth century but which was
applied mainly during the seventeenth century.  It made it
possible to legalize properties whose titles were not in
order.)  They sought to make improvements by
constructing, for example, buildings, irrigation systems,
roads, granaries, and shelters for livestock.  Together,
these made it possible to increase agricultural yields
substantially.  It was not an easy process, often involving
transfers of hacienda property, severe indebtedness of
their owners, and great difficulties in production.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Hacienda expansion proceeded throughout the following two
centuries.  Huge tracts of uncultivated land were
transformed into farmland and impressive water
distribution systems opened up new areas to irrigation.  The
population, constantly growing, demanded an ever greater
quantity of food.  Much land that had been
devoted to the raising of livestock was turned over to
cultivation, and the stock were gradually displaced until
livestock haciendas came to be located mainly in the
north of the country.  However, this was not a period of
unimpeded progress: there were severe periods of crisis,
sharp fluctuations in production, a lack of continuity
in the transmission of property, and frequent bankruptcies.
Hacienda properties tended to be deeply mortgaged to
ecclesiastical institutions and to individual lenders.

<p class="noindent">
When dictator Porfirio Díaz assumed power in 1877, a boom
period for the hacienda began.  Historical circumstances
were favorable, and the government offered all
manner of facilities to the livestock and farm impresarios.
The substantial increase in the country's population, as
well as the strengthening international economy,
created a great demand for farm and livestock products.  The
consumption of goods from the tropics, such as coffee,
cacao, sugar, tobacco, and vanilla, grew
considerably during this time both in Europe and in the
United States.  The same thing happened with certain basic
materials, among them <i>henequén</i>, rubber, chicle,
and <i>ixtle</i>.  (<i>Ixtle</i> or <i>istle</i> is the name given to the hard
fibers that are extracted from different plants of the
genus agave, of which the most important are the <i>maguey</i>
and the <i>lechuguilla</i>.  They are raised mainly in northern
Mexico.)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As a result of laws that secularized communal land and set
aside fallow land, huge areas of cultivation and land
suitable for farming were placed at the disposition of
commercial agriculture.  Supporting capital for the most
part came from foreign sources&mdash;from the United States,
France, and England.  Labor came from the
impoverished peasants, from town workers, and from
indigenous groups, among them the Mayas and the Tarahumaras.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Large landed estates appeared and a powerful class of
hacienda owners arose.  It was during this period that it
was possible to overcome some of the endemic
problems that had beset the hacienda since its birth:
instability, indebtedness, lack of capital, and scarce
revenues.  During the Porfiriato, the majority of the haciendas
were highly productive and provided their owners with
plentiful earnings.  Yet, at the same
time there were haciendas that had to face financial
problems and fluctuations in production.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Frequently, hacendados participated in other areas of
business, such as finance, commerce, and mining.  Their
privileged economic position permitted them to furnish
their rural properties with great luxury and to sustain a
life of affluence.  Bartlett found hacienda residences with
twenty bedrooms, salons for dancing, Japanese
gardens, billiard rooms and music rooms, swimming pools,
bullrings, and palisades.  Bearing witness to the interior
splendor of these mansions, there was fine furniture
from Europe, carpeting from Persia, velvet draperies,
chandeliers of cut crystal, and valuable oil paintings.
There were haciendas that possessed chapels that rivaled
the provincial churches in size, architecture, and decor.
Of course not all haciendas were this elegant: most had
much more rustic appointments; many were in decline,
poorly maintained, furnished with the very barest minimum.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bartlett captured and transmits to us today through his art
the grand cultural richness that enfolds the hacienda, its
diversity according to its moment in time, its location,
and its type of production, and he accompanies these with a
portrayal of hacienda life, customs, and its inherent style
of thought.  He is one of the pioneers in his field of
study.

<p>
Forty years ago, traveling by train in Mexico, I saw, in
remote areas, what appeared to be miniature villages.  I
made sketches of them from the train and later visited
some of the sites and learned they were ancient haciendas.
Over the years since then, I have visited 330 haciendas and
made the first art record of these estates.  I
traveled on horseback, on foot, by bus, train, car, truck,
motorbike, and mule-drawn, narrow-gauge railway.  I saw that
haciendas had become mere place-names as
they disintegrated or were bulldozed.
</p>

<p>
Walk into a handsome mansion and you find twenty or thirty
empty rooms.  To escape the revolution, the owner fled years
earlier.  Earthquakes, weather, and
abandonment have riddled walls and floors.  The residence
stands roofless, windowless, doorless&mdash;constructed of stone,
brick and adobe, or a combination of these.
Church and chapel exist at every hacienda and they are
still used by neighbors and peasants who may occupy the
manor house.  There are dates on bell skirts, on
walls or beams of a storage bodega, on escutcheons, on
archways; often they are carved in the mesquite floor of a
chapel or church.

In the tropics, flame trees, bougainvillea, red-orange
galeanas, lavender jacaranda, and yellow primavera flower
among ruins.  In northern areas, pine, tall eucalypti,
mesquite, cedar, pepper, and chinaberry remain.
</p>

<p>
I sketched under the tropic sun, in corrals, in a bullring,
under an Indian laurel; I poked through empty rooms.
</p>

<p>
As I sketched, burro trains passed, their sacks loaded with
charcoal or corn; goat bells tapped as a herd grazed; ox
teams hauled carts with wooden wheels;
blackbirds crowded a treetop; a cowboy tipped his hat.
</p>

<p>
There was always courtesy.  I drank <i>pulque</i> from a communal
gourd; I shared pineapple grown in Tecomán; I was
entertained at town houses of hacendados.  On the
estates there was silence from the days of the viceroys,
the silence of padres, the silence of abandonment.

<p>
In the sixteenth century, following the Spanish invasion of
Mexico between the years 1519 and 1521, the Spanish Crown
granted enormous land areas to the
conquerors and adventurers who came to the New World.  Since
this property belonged to the natives, the grants amounted
to usurpation.  Scattered throughout
Mexico, from Yucatán to Sonora, the extensive holdings
frequently included towns and villages.  These grants of
land were the origin of the haciendas, the rural estates.
</p>

<p>
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spanish
immigrants sometimes passed themselves off as
noblemen&mdash;camouflaging criminal or poverty-stricken
backgrounds.  Others, with a sack of cash or a pair of
brawny shoulders, used the invasion as an opportunity to
bluff their way and claim land and lives through the
power of the sword.  They remembered that dropping
quicksilver into a mule's ear made the animal trot faster.
Wealthy immigrants were able to purchase titles, and
this arrangement was encouraged by the Crown since it
benefited the treasury.
</p>

<p>
The hacendado (or his representative) employed or coerced
native workers to build a residence, church or chapel,
storage buildings, mills, dams, aqueducts, fences,
and roads.  He paid lip service to the Crown and whenever
possible circumvented legalities.  It was advantageous to
sidestep the Crown since a letter or document took
half a year to reach Spain.  The employer was unable to
communicate with the people who spoke Otomi, Coro, or
Chichiméc.  He was thwarted by new diseases,
strange customs, tropical climate, and crop problems.
Unlike the countries of Europe, Mexico was a corn culture,
not a wheat culture.  During his first years he learned
that grain did better when planted in the most primitive
manner, by stick and foot.

As rapidly as possible, the landowner, the <i>hacendado</i>, added
to his holdings, buying or usurping acreage.  An hacienda
might consist of several thousand or several
million acres.  The terrain might be mountainous,
semi-desert, coastal strips, forest or jungle, or a combination
of topographical zones.  There were cattle haciendas,
sheep haciendas, mining haciendas, pulque/tequila haciendas;
others produced henequén, grew coffee, sugarcane, corn,
wheat.  A few bred bulls for the bullring.
</p>

<p>
During the first century of the occupation, Fray Bartolomé
de Las Casas, friend of the Indians, objected to the
atrocities committed by the Spanish.  Alfonso de Zorita,
writing his "Brevíssima Relación," exposed Indian
mistreatment.  Burnouf, French agronomist, wrote Emperor
Maximilian that the whip of the <i>mayordomo</i> (the
hacendado's administrator) was destroying many lives.
Regardless of objections through the years, the hacienda
system prospered.
</p>

<p>
Counts, countesses, dukes and duchesses, crude invasionists,
wealthy men, and religious orders owned estates.  Some of
the famous hacendados were Hernán Cortéz,
Porfirio Díaz, Martín Ruiz de Zavala, General Santa Anna,
and Pancho Villa (who was given his hacienda as a political
bribe).  Famous families owned estates:
Terrazas, Rosa, Amor, Jaral, Ibarra, Echeverría, and Regla.
</p>

<p>
From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, hacienda
architecture varied: Where generation after generation
owned the hacienda, in families of great wealth,
façades were gothic, churrigueresque, plateresque, Islamic,
baroque, rococo.  The most widespread architectural style
derived from the Roman.  Most residences had
their living quarters around an <i>atrium</i>, or patio.  Grilled
windows and massive wooden doors and shutters were common.
Thousands of work-hours went into the
carvings and embellishments&mdash;in gray, pink, or yellowish
limestone.  <i>Hornacinas</i> (niches) peppered a church or chapel
façade.

<p>
Each niche contained a saint or religious figure: It was
tapestry in stone.
</p>

<p>
In the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, tiled façades
ornamented the hacienda residences and lofty walls
surrounded them.  Church and chapel domes were also tiled.  In
the Sierras, haciendas were often built of logs and planed
wood&mdash;rustic, two-story buildings with outside stairways.  In
the tropics, the usual residence was one story
with ample verandas and deep-set doors and windows.  Most
buildings were roofed in cone-shaped, interlocking, or flat
tiles.
</p>

<p>
The majority of hacienda structures were skillfully
mortared in stone block <i>cantera</i> (limestone) by rule-of-thumb.
Professional architects like Francisco Eduardo de
Tresguerras were seldom available.  Instead, artisans were
employed who used various styles learned from early
ecclesiastical buildings.
</p>

<p>
Bitter rivalries between estates were part of the scene.
Owners were on the alert for a bankrupt
hacienda that could be purchased at a very low price.  If
extending landholdings meant violating the rights of a
village or of an individual farmer or rancher, those rights
were brushed aside, or contested legally.

<p>
To bolster his stature, the hacendado placed a baronial
device on the façade of his residence or church: A coat-of-arms
elevated his status.  He also respected his skin,
and against the threat of <i>la intrusa</i> (the intruder) he
installed gun slots, grilled windows, studded doors, and
armed his retainers.  <i>La intrusa</i> was his Old World
enemy.  Now and then he raised a private army to repel
difficult natives, belligerent hacendados, or
revolutionaries.  Thick-walled, ponderous buildings
reflected his
philosophy.  They indicated his loneliness and his fear of
death as well.
</p>

<p>
As life became less threatening in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, as roads improved and travel became
safer and more comfortable, hacienda owners
erected open structures: Residences appeared with multiple
arches across the front, and tiled verandas led to the
outdoors.  Two-story homes, with balconies on the
second floor became common.  Eucalypti, jacaranda, chirimoya,
and columnar cypress shaded a complex of buildings: church,
residence, <i>bodega</i>.  In the north
country, a line of cottonwoods led to the gracious house,
which was stuccoed pink or pale yellow.  Farther south, a
grove of palms graced the setting.
</p>

<p>
As time passed, viceroys, churchmen, lawyers, and teachers
became more and more aware of the language barriers that
existed throughout the country and that
impeded progress.  The Catholics, through their <i>colegios</i>
(ecclesiastical schools) attempted to upgrade life.  There
were no public schools.
</p>

<p>
Among the ecclesiastical orders, the Jesuits were major
hacienda owners.  Their design-for-living began at 4:00 A.M. and
ended at 7:00 P.M.  At the most famous
Jesuit hacienda, Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, slaves were
purchased, bred, sold, or retained for work on the estate.
There were no fiestas at Santa Lucía.  For
almost two hundred years the hacienda functioned to support
the ecclesiastical schools of the order.  The Colegio Máximo,
in Mexico City, was the principal
beneficiary.  Until June 25, 1767, when all Jesuits were
deported from Mexico, the estate prospered, selling wheat,
corn, textiles, cattle, sheep, and slaves.  Its
economic influence extended as far as Guadalajara, Zapotlán,
and Colima.
</p>

<p>
Schooling at the hacienda was largely disregarded.  There
were sixty foreign dialects to contend with.  There were no
dictionaries, no language bridges for the Zapotec,
Coro, Méxica, and Nahuatl people.  On the estates a priest
or teacher, one who knew a little Latin, gave lessons in
Spanish, arithmetic, Latin, and the catechism.
Scholarly priests began linguistic studies of some tribes;
they edited dictionaries, but these were never circulated.
Some of their work has yet to be published.
</p>

<p>
<i>Machismo</i> was more meaningful to the average estate than
education.  The blacksmith from Barcelona, who now owned
ninety thousand acres, was eager for
compliant women.  Sex life, for the invaders, for the
colonist, was freer than in Europe.  Since the men did not
speak the Indian dialects, sex was a body language.
Some were promiscuous and guilty of perversion.  Priests and
nuns were shocked by their animality and attempted to
control their countrymen.  Since most haciendas
were remote and few women accompanied the settlers,
isolation and power granted license.
</p>

<p>
The kindly man, the gentile man, looked for other ways to
overcome loneliness, isolation, homesickness.  Some,
preferring the familiar life, returned to their homeland.
By 1910, thousands of estates were scattered across the
country.  Mansions were located in the midst of maguey and
henequén fields or were situated in lush valleys.
Some faced the ocean; some were lost in acres of corn;
miles of range country surrounded others; there were desert
haciendas with the nearest neighbor fifty miles
away; there were rain forest haciendas, mahogany haciendas.
Many were regional landmarks.

One of the most famous haciendas, in the state of Jalisco,
is Ciénega de Mata, legalized by the Crown in 1697.  Owned
by the Rincón Gallardo family, it was a tract of
eighty-seven estancias (ranches).  According to Alfonso
Rincón Gallardo, reminiscing about his father's estate, the
residence was built during the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth
centuries.  It is a two-story building with twenty rooms and
spans or arches across the front.  The church is gray
limestone, like the residence, with a baroque façade.  An
elaborate coat-of-arms embellishes the entry.  Sculptured
pink stone <i>cantera</i> saints and angels fill various niches.
The octagonal dome and tower are richly carved.

Gallardo appreciated the life at Ciénega, the brandings,

Every morning after breakfast, all of us&mdash;my father dressed
in his charro outfit; my mother attired English style&mdash;would
set out on horseback, riding about the hacienda's vast
fields of corn and barley.  After the midday meal, back at
the house, we walked about the stables, the granaries, and
over a small hill that lay nearby; and sometimes we played
fronton or went out riding
again.  At night, after supper, we read or played games.  In
this tranquil, pleasant manner, life went on, broken only
by the annual festival, an event celebrated on a grand
scale with
parades, banquets, horse races, cockfights, boxing matches,
and, in the evening, a fantastic display of fireworks.

Brantz Mayer, secretary of the United States Legation in
Mexico during 1841 and 1842, enjoyed a horseback visit to
the Hacienda de San Nicolás, near Tetécala, in
the state of Mexico.  He admired the white buildings and the
neatness of the estate: "The sugarcane fields were in
capital order, the roads smooth, the fences
maintained; cattle were under the care of herdsmen."

The <i>mayordomo</i> was hospitable and accommodated Mayer and his

walked among the hacienda's fields of
sugarcane.  He inspected
the <i>tienda de raya</i> (the general store), and the hacienda's
offices, kitchens, parlors, bedrooms, and an "immense
corridor of arches filled with caged birds, hung with
hammocks, where the family pass most of the long warm days
of summer."

In 1833, travelers Emma Undsay Squier and her husband were
guests at a tequila hacienda, Ometusco, about an hour and a
half by horseback from Mexico City.
From the railroad station, the complex appeared like a
"salmon-pink birthday cake in the
shape of a walled fortress."  The buildings were surrounded
by fields of maguey.  The Squiers entered the grounds
through a large gateway where soldiers lounged.  The
walled patio was enormous and paved with stone.  Burros
trotted by, bearing casks of freshly collected <i>agua miel</i>
(sap of the maguey).
</p>

<p>
Ometusco was the size of a village; the hacendado's home
was a palace of many rooms, kitchens, winding stairways,
patios, poultry yards, corrals.  The largest patio,
centered by a stone fountain, was planted with flowers,
trees, and flowering vines.  A tiny school had its own patio.
The chapel was elaborate.  Guests enjoyed a billiard
room in the main house.  Each bedroom had beds protected by
mosquito netting.  The dining room could seat seventy
persons at a mahogany table.  Inlaid buffets
glittered with silver and glassware, seldom to be seen
after the revolutionary period of 1910-1914.

By 1952, the renowned Hacienda Cabezón had become a mere
<i>casco</i> (a shell).  Located about 48 miles from Guadalajara,
near Ameca, the residence was designed
in 1780 by the famous architect Francisco Eduardo de
Tresguerras.  Now, grunting, shuffling pigs have squatters'
rights to the fifteen rooms.  The building is roofless; its
handpainted bedroom walls are open to the weather, all that
remains of the handsome structure, once the focal point of
fifteen or twenty <i>sitios</i> (ranches), is the chapel,
pewless, clean, its walls faded red, gold, and yellow.
Swallows fly in and out of their nests in the gold
curlicues of the reredos.

Cabezón has a single treasure: the Virgin of Candelaria,
protected by a plate-glass case.  Her face seems Andalusian.
Colored scrolls, garlands, and angels frame her
as she stands on a silver crescent moon, her figure the
center of a gilded <i>reredo</i>.  About 18 inches tall, she wears
a white satin gown sewn with gold.  A jeweled pearl
crown rests on her hair, making her the perfect madonna.
Close by, under the dark mesquite floor, members of the
hacienda family are buried: Ignacio Cañedo de
Valdivierlos (1836); Estanislao Cañedo (1887); Manuel
Calixto Cañedo (1905).
</p>

<p>
According to a chiseled inscription, the floor was laid in
1858 and cost 166 pesos.

The land belonging to the famous ecclesiastical hacienda,
Santa Lucía, was purchased by the Jesuits on December
4, 1576.  Legally, the estate's area measured 18.8
square miles, an area populated by Otomi, Tepaneca, and
Chichimeca Indians.  At the time of its purchase it had
16,800 sheep, 1,400 goats, 125 brood mares and
colts, 1 stallion, 1 saddle horse, 2 donkey mares, 2 donkey
stallions, and 8 slaves.
</p>

<p>
During the 1580s, construction work was carried out on
residences, offices, storage buildings, corrals, sheds, and
quarters for the slaves.  A chapel was built in 1592.
The hacienda produced barley, oats, beans, wheat, corn,
chickpeas, and livestock: cattle, sheep, goats, mules, and
horses, in increasing numbers each year.  Santa
Lucía prospered for nearly two centuries.

Cuisillos is another Jalisco hacienda, a place of jacaranda,
palms, eucalyptus, ash, and mesquite, near Cabezón.  Horizon
hills are often steel blue, and a low-lying
volcano is often misty gray.  Cuisillos, deeded in 1620,
first belonged to Juan González de Apodaca, chief constable
under Cortéz.  During the sixteenth century it was
one of the largest estates in Mexico and added
substantial revenues to the Crown.  Neoclassic, its <i>casa
principal</i> (main house) and chapel form an L, and fronting
the L is a grove of palms.  The main house has thirty
rooms, two tiled patios with a fountain in each; in the
main patio there are fourteen fresco panels painted in 1910
of seascapes, landscapes, and scenes of women in
the eighteenth century.
</p>

<p>
The grilled patio gate bears the renovation date 1910 and
the hacienda brand and family monogram.  All rooms are still
roofed and floored.  The house is putting up a
valiant struggle.  Its primitive kitchen has an igloo-shaped
oven with a charcoal basket dangling from its chimney pipe.
A corkscrew limestone stairway leads to the
chapel tower where there are bronze bells whose skirt dates
are 1895, 1895, 1896, and 1896; the fifth bell has no date.
The chapel façade is ornate.  The interior is
simple: a small <i>coro</i> (choir gallery), with a small darkwood
organ that is badly battered.  The walls of the chapel are
white and gold.

A neighboring hacienda is architecturally imposing.  The
Hacienda Cañedo has a church that would be outstanding in
any city.  The building, of yellow limestone, is
baroque-Italianate.  It towers above the surrounding
structures and is amazing for its spire and its twelve
stone apostles in the forecourt&mdash;8-foot carvings of limestone
on stone pedestals&mdash;native craft at its finest.
</p>

<p>
The church interior is blue, white, and gold.  Sedate.  The
black mesquite floor has a carved strip leading to the
altar, and the words on the strip indicate when the floor
was laid and what it cost.  Altar and decorations are simple:
brass candle holders, vases with paper flowers.  There are
solid-backed wooden pews in cedar.  The room
expresses spaciousness.
</p>

<p>
The residence, which adjoins the church, is a stone mansion
with badly scaled walls.  All rooms are vacant except the
kitchen, a charcoal-blackened room with
smudged clay pots and a row of cracked white plates in
racks above a tiled stone stove.  Around this <i>casco</i> are
other buildings, storage rooms&mdash;all stone, all
neglected.  At one time, according to a wall sign, there was
a <i>biblioteca rural</i> (rural library) in the complex.

In the state of Hidalgo, the Hacienda de San Francisco&mdash;a
pulque estate&mdash;was refurbished in 1880.  The twenty-room
mansion stands in a giant field of maguey ringed
by hills.  Fifty carriages could park in front.  Once there
were twin swimming pools, a bullring, and fifty Japanese
gardeners to maintain the gardens.
</p>

<p>
The residence has rooms around a flower-weed-garbage patio.
The building is in a pseudo Arabian-Spanish style.  On a
wall there is a crank-style phone.  There
is electricity and a broken television antenna.  A large
<i>sala</i> (parlor) has a number of ornate tables, tufted velvet
couches, and silk-damask chairs; imported brocaded
drapes are fastened by gold sashes, all from France via
train, ox cart, and tumpline.  On the stairway leading to
the roof, the hacienda workers killed the owner in
1910.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally there are guests, weekenders.  Barefooted girls
wearing braids serve among the antiques.

Far south, in Yucatán, Yaxcopoíl is a working henequén
hacienda, a survivor of two centuries, still semi-successful
economically.  Located about forty miles from
Mérida, on the Uxmal-Campeche highway, the residence forms
a U.  Residence, chapel, offices, and storage space are
eighteenth-century structures.  The main house
has thirteen arches along its broad
veranda and micro-chapel.  This section of the complex is
connected by an imposing pillared breezeway to the dining
room, kitchen, and servants' quarters.

The floor of the extensive patio between these buildings is
paved with flagstone carved with Mayan glyphs and designs,
appropriated from nearby ruins on the
property.  The residence is furnished in eighteenth and
nineteenth-century styles with marble-topped tables, bronze
and brass beds, dangling chain lamps with
handpainted globes and shades, henequén hammocks, and
tanned hides on tile floors.  Bathroom fixtures are British
and washbasins with silver faucets bear a
porcelainized coat-of-arms.
</p>

<p>
There are reed chairs in the living room.  Mediocre prints
and a seventeenth-century religious canvas decorate the
walls.  The floor tiles are conventional in pattern;
there are no rugs; the ceiling beams are stenciled in
pastel floral designs.  Double doors lead to the veranda.
The dining room has a center table with a Tiffany-type
lamp.  In the office there are chairs, an oak desk, a
handpress, and a bookcase.
</p>

<p>
In the micro-chapel, its wall decorated with gold and
silver fleur-de-lys and pink roses, there is a large
sixteenth-century canvas by an accomplished, anonymous artist:
the descent from the cross, with eight or ten figures
merging with the background.  There are no chairs.  The altar
is small, insignificant.  A white Seybold organ, a silver
crucifix, a pair of silver candles on a side table complete
the furnishings.
</p>

<p>
Behind the residence stands a theater with simple stone
façade and pilaster figures of women representing spring,
summer, autumn, and winter.  A windmill spins behind
a carved Mayan head perched on the roof line.  The
auditorium accommodates a couple of hundred people for
movies and plays.

The henequén production mill consists of a large open shed
with a corrugated roof.  There is a machine press for
crushing the maguey leaves, which are hauled in by
narrow-gauge flat cars, pulled
by mules or Ford-engine.  There are fence-like racks behind
the mill for drying thousands of fibers at one time.
Employees here work on salary; today there are no

The imposing Hacienda San José Huejotzingo is near the city
of Puebla in the state of Puebla.  Its stark one-story red brick,
white brick façade faces a lane of dying
elm and willow.  The residence measures 170 feet across the
front.  At each corner there is an ornamental tower.  The
house encloses two patios.  Destroyed by
revolutionaries, its chapel and storage areas are roofless,
but the residential rooms have been reconditioned.  They are
filled with
<i>recuerdos</i> (mementos): incunabula, antique firearms, a suit
of Italian armor, oil paintings, Aztec figures, charro
spurs, leather chests, colonial tables and chairs.
</p>

<p>
In the dining room are tall ecclesiastical wooden
candelabra, carved cedar chairs, monogrammed chests,
pre-Columbian objects, colonial pottery, and old dishes.
Modern Tonalá pottery ornaments a nineteenth-century buffet.
Throughout the residence the floors are red tile.
</p>

<p>
The central patio has a 5-foot limestone statue of
St. Joseph, carved in 1624.  It stands near a wall tile that
reads: <i>Margarita Barrados, died June 3, 1871</i>.  A stone
plaque of a conquistador on horseback, in primitive style,
decorates another wall.
</p>

<p>
The property&mdash;a corn, wheat, and cattle estate dating from
Cortesian days&mdash;is owned by Juan Matienzo, who has made a
hobby of reconstructing his ancestral home.
Few other haciendas have Popocatépetl's 18,000-foot peak
looming behind.

San Martín Rinconada, a feudal hacienda, is halfway between
Puebla and Jalapa on the Jalapa route.  The buildings are
enclosed in a compound.  The protective walls,
30 feet high, are in good condition&mdash;mellowed by age.
Extensive cornfields surround the compound, which is about
one half-block square.
</p>

<p>
An intricate grilled gateway opens to a plateresque church.
The church clock keeps time, and the stone sundial by the
corral also keeps time, hacienda time.  Behind
the church, a windowless chapel, with double doors for
light and air, contains five mauled wooden desks, dusty
benches of adzed wood, and a cracked blackboard.
This was once a school.
</p>

<p>
Outside the compound, facing the church, are adobe huts
roofed with straw.  They accommodated the workers, their
poultry, pigs, and dogs.  Perhaps one hundred
people lived in the twenty huts.  A shingle-roofed <i>pozo</i>
(well) supplies water for horses, cattle, and people,
spilling it into a
20-foot wooden trough.  Gun slots in the compound walls
slant toward the well and trough.  Zapatistas and
Carrancistas threatened the hacienda in 1914; they banged
on the residence door and demanded beef and saddle horses
but left the property undamaged.
</p>

<p>
Now empty, the bedrooms are papered in gold and white and
are semi-frescoed overhead.  A minute patio, facing several
bedrooms, has a few shabby cypress.  The
<i>sala</i> has no furnishings.
</p>

<p>
Stained-glass windows, humble panes of colored glass, light
the auditorium that seated one hundred people.  Behind a
plaster life-size Christ on the altar hangs a dark
red velvet drape; nearby, on the same wall, is a tortured
Christus.  A pair of prayer wheels stands by the altar.
Chandeliers are encased in white covers, carefully tied.
There are stubby oak candelabra with fat candles that have
dripped wax.  A foxed, framed letter is dated 1742.

<p>
Life on an hacienda was basically agrarian, revolving
around the care of livestock, poultry, planting, harvesting,
crop storage, irrigation, and general maintenance.  If the
estate was located in an area that included tropical
low-level land, mountainous terrain, and semi-desert,
administration was complex.  The thousands of acres had to
be supervised on horseback.  Weather was a daily concern.
Keeping a competent work force was an ever-changing problem.
</p>

<p>
The personnel of an hacienda consisted of a mayordomo (the
administrator), minor supervisors, field workers, cowhands,
shepherds, blacksmiths, masons, saddlers,
cobblers, carpenters, woodcutters, weavers, a stable boss
and assistants, errand boys, a barber, a chandler,
gardeners, dairymen, maids, butler, cooks, seamstresses,
the manager of the tienda de raya, butchers, a priest, an
organist, a teacher, a governess, and sometimes a doctor.
The bigger the estate, the bigger the staff.  All were
responsible to the hacendado who lived on the hacienda or who
was an absentee owner-administrator.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the
haciendas became increasingly self-sufficient.  Isolated as
they were, they made every effort to provide for their own
needs: water, food, carriages, wagons, carts, saddles,
shoes, spurs, harnesses, clothing, linen.  Equipment like
saws, plows, pumps, pipe, guns, and machetes had to be
"imported."
</p>

<p>
The hacendado, his family, and staff ate an early breakfast.
Bells clanged for a Mass at 6:00 or 7:00 A.M. (before or
after breakfast), depending on the weather.  In
most tropical regions, work commenced at dawn to escape the
noon heat; during the summer, work was often suspended
around midday and resumed late in the
afternoon.

<p>
Each morning, the hacendado found his clothes laid out by
his mozo (valet), perhaps his charro outfit, a shirt, socks,
sombrero, pistol, boots, gloves, and quirt.  His
breakfast menu included fruit, eggs, meat dishes, beans, tortillas,
or <i>pan dulces</i> (varied sweet rolls).  The chef offered coffee,
chocolate, tea, pulque, or beer.  Cuban cigars were favored.
Mounted on a well-groomed thoroughbred,
riding western saddle, the hacendado checked crops, cattle,
corrals, granary, irrigation project, and village laborers.
He also conferred with village <i>caciques</i> (chiefs).
During a lifetime the hacendado rode some 60,000 miles.

The hacendada looked after her staff, her maids, the
governess, the tutor, she allocated tasks: sheets to be
laundered, soap to be made, the purchase of <i>manta</i> for
linen, clothes to be mended, skirts to be hemmed.  If guests
were expected, the dinner menu had to be carefully planned.
Children, relatives, friends&mdash;they were all
important.  Supplies had to be brought to the hacienda from
the nearest village or town: kerosene, salt, lamps, matches, drugs.
</p>

<p>
By 2:00 or 2:30 P.M., it was time to eat.  At a kind of
makeshift picnic, the workers shared their clay pots of hot
beans or rice, their
tortillas, and pulque.  Sometimes there was meat with the rice
or beans: chicken, pork, beef, goat.  In season, there were
zapotes, mangos, oranges, avocados, bananas,
chirimoyas.  Workers wore cast-offs: torn shirts, torn
trousers, battered hats; the women were usually dressed in
blue cotton dresses and blue and white rebozos.  They
ate in the fields, in the kitchen, in the corral and
stables&mdash;sharing their food.

<p>
At the same hour, inside the big house, the hacendado, his
family, and guests enjoyed a meal at the long table set
with imported or hacienda linen, elegant china, cut
glass, and Mexican and European silverware.  Barefoot maids
served.  Perhaps the maids wore Tehuana or Yucatecan dresses.
The butler may have worn white
gloves.  In the spacious, beamed, windowed room, cool in
summer, warm in winter, the menu was varied:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Hors d'oeuvres<br />
<br />
  Soup<br />
<br />
  <i>Sopa Seca</i> (pasta, rice, etc.)<br />
<br />
  Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, venison&mdash;or<br />
  a combination of these (Turkey, rabbit,<br />
  quail, fish, when available)<br />
  <i>Flan</i> (custard), <i>chongo</i> (a milk and<br />
  syrup confection), <i>cajeta</i> (caramelized<br />
  goat's milk), cake&mdash;or fresh fruit and<br />
  cheese<br />
<br />
  Coffee, tea, wine, liquor, <i>horchata</i><br />
  (a rice drink), <i>jamaica</i> (a tropical drink),<br />
  chocolate.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Wine and liquor were both domestic and imported.  Both local
and imported cheeses were served, as well as European
delicacies like caviar, marmalades, jellies,
mints, nuts, and bon-bons.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, the siesta called for relaxation, comfortable
chairs, hammocks.  A well-earned sense of ease took over.  A
few guests played pool or billiards, bridge,
rummy, pinochle.  At dusk, croquet was a favorite game.  Some
estates had a swimming pool or access to a river, lake, or
ocean playa.

At a Jesuit hacienda, a peasant who failed to attend Mass
might be lashed; but the average hacienda was lenient about
attendance.  At evening Mass after a day's
labor, the workers were glad to kneel or squat: the hour
was a humble reward.  Hymns were sung.  Someone played the
organ or piano.
</p>

<p>
Each chapel or church boasted an altar&mdash;a lace-covered table
with paper flowers or a rococo gilded carving, with <i>santos</i>
(saints) and angels in the gray niches.  The
Virgin or saint was the focal point.  Stained-glass and onyx
windows appeared in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Marble and onyx sometimes replaced
mesquite or tiled floors.  Some chapels and churches had
pews, but in those without furniture the workers knelt.  As
for the hacienda family, they sat on cane chairs or
worshipped behind a screened <i>coro</i>.  There was a clear
distance between them and the "unwashed."

Most services were conducted in Latin, a language disliked
by the Indians because they
considered it an affront to their integrity.  Spanish was a
tribulation and Latin was another.  When they memorized
songs in Latin or Spanish, they often mispronounced
words intentionally.

Crucifixes were evident in most places of worship.  The
figure of Christ was sometimes pornographic in style,
sometimes tragic.  "Yerma," Federico Garcia Lorca's
tragic evocation, was brought to life again and again.
</p>

<p>
Young people grew up seeing marriage distorted, warped by
superstition and rigid conventions.  They learned to admire
martyrs.  They learned that the body was
unclean&mdash;putrefying.  The bloody cross hung in countless
minds.  With a cross dangling at her throat, the señorita
made confections: sugar skulls.  "A Nun's Cry" was the
name of a confection.  Hacienda loneliness did strange things;
it summoned <i>duendes</i> (spirits).  In this remote place, the
church bred intolerance&mdash;deep whispers of
death and damnation.

Great art&mdash;when it could be found&mdash;added to extremism.
St. Sebastian and his arrow-pierced body, Murillo and his
forlorn madonnas, Caravaggio and his rebellious saints&mdash;each
tilted the mind a little further askew.  However,
there was great music at some estates.  Freighted by train,
retransported in sections by ox cart, the London Broadway
piano brought Bach, Händel, and Couperin to
the señora's <i>sala</i>.  Most haciendas had a sala cluttered with
heirlooms: horsehair sofas, tapestry chairs, wicker rockers,
a parotta table, an ormolu screen, an inlaid
card table, brass spittoons, and a whatnot of oriental
ivory carvings.

Since most work was onerous and the hours long, with most
workers undernourished and small-boned, the haciendas faced
labor problems.  Most man-hours went
into agricultural jobs; in some areas where the water
supply was critical, wells had to be dug and serviced,
pipelines demanded upkeep.  If an aqueduct supplied the
estate, the canal, its outlets, and spans had to be
maintained.  In the fields&mdash;across thousands of acres&mdash;there
was planting, weeding, harvesting, and shucking to be
done.  There were beans, peppers, and tomatoes to pick.
Fences had to be repaired.  The cycles continued, altered by
rain or drought, by pests and soil failure.

The most capable agronomists were the Jesuits; their
haciendas achieved the best production records.  Their
workers often were treated with a measure of
consideration.  The Jesuit conduct
book called for respect.  This 200-page bible of
<i>Instrucciónes</i>, written in the sixteenth century, forbade
the whip, ball and chain, and the pillory.  Yet even so, Jesuit
cruelty was evident.  In Santa Lucía, administrators chained
mill workers and left skeletons of men in chains in
subterranean rooms.  In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled
from New Spain.  By 1810, Augustinians, Carmelites,
Dominicans, and Franciscans owned more than half of the
nation's real estate.
</p>

<p>
As for slavery on the haciendas, when is a man a slave?  He
is a slave if he works in perpetual debt.  If he cannot,
under penalty of imprisonment and death, leave the
hacienda and work elsewhere, he is a slave.  From the days
of the <i>encomiendas</i> (land grant estates) until 1910, workers
were enslaved by the hacienda.  A small
hacienda kept ten or twelve black slaves.  Since there were
approximately eight thousand haciendas in 1910, the total
of black slaves must have reached many
thousands.  A large hacienda kept one hundred to one hundred
and fifty slaves, of all ages.  There is no accurate count,
but it is clear that black slavery played an
important role in the hacienda system.

Disharmony was common among the ethnic groups: negro,
mulatto, mestizo, Creole, Zapotec, Méxica, Chichimeca,
Yaqui.  The mores of each group were affected by
Spanish customs and demands.  Ethnic problems existed at
each estate to varying degrees.  At the mining hacienda, the
sugar refining hacienda, and the vast cattle
properties, the worker was less valuable than the horse.
Big jobs and big land grants minimized personalities;
anonymity took over.  At the mine holdings, workers
grubbed for ore 1,000 feet below.  They worked almost naked,
without adequate food, drank contaminated water, climbed
precarious ladders in shafts faintly lit.  Men,
women, and children were employed.  In principle, they were
to work for a few days and then return home, but they
worked until they were ill or until they died.
Overseers were unwilling to spare
the workers.  There was no medical care.

With their mining, sugar refinery, and cattle properties,
the hacendados were proud of their affluence, evident in
their elegant mansions, ornate churches, endowed
schools, and hospitals.  They lived like Carolingian kings
as they traveled from one hacienda to another, attended by
friends, relatives, and parasites.  They were famed
for their hospitality, hated for their cruelty, kowtowed to
when they went abroad.

Rincón Gallardo reminisced about his hacienda life:
</p>

<p class="quote">
I spent my vacations with friends at Tlalayote, near Apán,
in the state of Hidalgo.  There we rode in the morning; in
the afternoon we hunted for pheasant, quail and rabbit, and,
near Tultengo Lake, for ducks.  Since there was no
automobile we went everywhere on horseback.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I can remember returning late from a hunt, the stars our
only guide, since the one we were supposed to use&mdash;Evaristo,
our groom&mdash;had by then a headful of pulque and was in no
shape to lead us home.  But once back at Tlalayote's main
house we handed over our game-bags to Miscaela, the
magnificent cook, who prepared several of the birds and served
us plentifully with great mugs of pulque brought in from
the fermenting shed.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This rural life seemed yet another indication of the land's
undying attraction.  As a young man I learned to ride charro
style, to throw a calf by its tail, to lasso on horseback and on
foot, to drive a six-mule team, to break wild colts and
calves, and use firearms of various kinds.
</p>

Haciendas were the home of the fiesta.  The first fiestas
were held shortly after the Conquest.  As the influence of
Catholicism spread, fiestas increased in number&mdash;honoring
a saint, commemorating a religious event, a
holiday, a wedding.  Generally, fiestas were initiated by
the peasants and represented a communal expression.  At
an hacienda village someone had to collect funds, arrange
for costumes, supervise church or chapel decorations,
commission the fireworks, hire or borrow musicians,
and arrange for food and drinks.  If the hacendado hosted a
fiesta, he might leave the details to his wife or the
<i>mayordomo</i>.  The priest and his assistant also managed
fiestas.
</p>

<p>
People came on foot, by ox cart, palanquin, burro, mule,
horse, wagon, and carriage&mdash;from distant haciendas and towns.
For some four hundred years fiestas livened
these feudal outposts that existed across the nation.  Guests
were often royalty or politically important: a viceroy, a
duke, a governor, or church dignitary.  Since
travel was usually tedious and fatiguing, everything was
done to make the festival memorable.

Sixteenth-century fiestas were announced by drums and the
<i>chirimía</i>&mdash;a shrill flute from Aztec-Toltec-Mayan days.
Dancers performed in front of the big house or
danced in a patio or on the tiles of the church plaza.  They
wore harlequin-like costumes, feathered headdresses,
conquest clothes, white trousers sashed with red,
giant sombreros, masks; they flaunted wands, shields,
spears, bows, and arrows.  Ankle rattles hissed.  Gourds
thumped and rustled.  Only male dancers participated.
</p>

<p>
In the far south, at estates in Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana
Roo, and Campeche, the marimba replaced the flute and drum.
Sometimes six or eight musicians pounded
out music simultaneously on four or five instruments.

In the north, on Sonoran and Chihuahuan haciendas, the
violin was the chief instrument.  Fashioned with no other
tools than pieces of glass and a knife, it
supplied basic rhythms, one or several instruments wailing for
Yaqui and Tarahumaran dances.

Flowers decked every fiesta.  Gardenias were tossed into the
fountains, carnations were woven into bell ropes, and
rambler roses were spun around ox cart wheels
and wagon wheels.  Blossoms filled churches and chapels with
fragrance, they crisscrossed patios on wires, they
brightened roadside shrines.
</p>

<p>
Food and drink were plentiful: tortillas, beans, beans
cooked with beef or chicken, pots and pots of beans, iron
caldrons of soup, meat barbecued on spits, ox and
goat, barrels of punch, buckets of pulque, barrels of beer,
bottles of tequila, and, of course, cognac&mdash;for the <i>gente de

husks), <i>muk-bil pollo</i> (chicken and pork tamale pie), <i>tamales
Veracruzanos</i> (pork-filled tamales), and <i>ate de guayaba</i>
(guava candy paste).  For special guests, the
chefs served more elaborate dishes: pheasant, quail,
javelina, venison, dove, rabbit.  There were no government
restrictions on wild game.  Fishermen contributed <i>gallo</i>

The guests gathered for cockfights.  If it was summertime, a
canopy shaded the pit.  In the highlands a <i>mozo</i> swept aside
pine needles and built a green fire to fight the
mosquitoes.  In the south, white awnings and striped
parasols furnished shade.  The cocks, which were uncaged at
a pit, were named: <i>Biba Manza</i>, <i>Panadero</i>,
<i>Porfirio</i>, <i>Tigre</i>, <i>Mi General</i>, and <i>El Rayo</i>.  At a signal the
birds flew at each other, their razor blades flashing.  Bets
were wagered ... a hundred ... a thousand ... five.

Every fiesta had popular dances: Cora Paixil, Moro, Tapatío,
Jarana.  The <i>gente</i> (people) danced in the sala or on a cool
veranda or outside by kerosene lamps, by
torches, by candlelight, under chandeliers in the big house,
by gasoline lamps&mdash;the illumination changing with the epoch.
Orchestras&mdash;brought by train from the
cities&mdash;played polkas, waltzes, rustic Bach, "La Bamba,"
"Torres de Pueblo," "There is Someone," and other current
favorites.  Mariachis, in their sequined black suits
and sprawling black hats, played and sang.  They were always
the favorites at every fiesta.
</p>

<p>
Dating from Aztec days, <i>Los Voladores</i> (pole dancers), were
the sensation.  Customarily, five men participated, first
dancing on the ground, then climbing a lofty pole
where they hurled themselves into space, roped by the feet.
Spinning round and round the pole, they gradually descended,
unwinding.
</p>

<p>
Fiestas lasted a single day or several days; sometimes they
became a <i>feria</i>, a market where vendors would set up booths and
display fabric, produce, herbs, pottery, machetes, knives.
Poultry and livestock were sold or
bartered.  Early in the sixteenth century, Spanish
bullfighters arrived and performed at haciendas near the
capital.
</p>

<p>
The elegantly-dressed cowboy, the <i>charro</i>, spent $1,000 on
his outfit; his trousers were skintight and had single or
double rows of silver buttons trimming the outside
seams.  His shirt was homespun cotton or handsomely
embroidered linen.  His jacket was embroidered and sequined.
His boots were made of inlaid leather, expertly
fitted.  His sombrero was ornamented with silver and silver
banded.  His stirrups and spurs were chased silver or gold,
and his saddle was inlaid with silver or gold.
</p>

<p>
It is not known when the first <i>castillo</i> (bamboo tower) spat
fire.  When there was ample gunpowder, someone fashioned a
windmill for pinwheels, rockets, Roman
candles, blazing globes of flame, and strings of tangled
lights.  It was a windmill of bamboo, a shivering, shaking
tower of color, 20 to 30 feet high.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the fiesta, workers dipped into the pulque casks.
They tried to dance off their intoxication; they did their
best to forget their hardships; sometimes they
found themselves in the hacienda jail.
</p>

<p>
Notables played billiards, pool and cards and tossed dice;
until far into the night they might gamble at the <i>Monte</i>
(card game) tables; when the fiesta came to an end
they laid down their cards reluctantly&mdash;it might be a long
way home.
</p>

<p>
July, August, September&mdash;the summer calendar rolled on and
new fiesta dates became important: Candlemas, Holy Week,
Corpus Christi, Día de Los Reyes.  On the
Day of Divine Proficience, candles burned for twenty-four
hours.  On carts and on men's shoulders, biblical floats
appeared: It was time for a reappraisal of faith, time
to honor the local Virgin.

<p>
In bygone days&mdash;two hundred years ago&mdash;an hacienda church or
chapel bell signaled school.  A youngster or priest or
acolyte yanked the bell rope.  In the tropics, if
you were lucky, you put on your <i>shirgo</i> (raincoat), and got
to school dry.  Your class started at 7:00 A.M. and lasted
until noon, when the heat moved in.  You walked
to your home for lunch or picked it off the trees as you
went home.  If school convened regularly you were fortunate.
You were fortunate if classes freed you from
hacienda chores.
</p>

<p>
In the temperate zone, school began about 9:00 A.M. and
reconvened after the siesta&mdash;closing at 4:00 P.M.  Again
intermittency played havoc with the sessions.  The
<i>maestro</i> (teacher) was very informal; if you had a teacher
who was dedicated, your education began to acquire meaning.
</p>

<p>
Teaching was in Spanish, though the pupils might speak one
or more of the sixty dialects.  For centuries the parents
objected to Spanish being taught; at home the children spoke
their native tongue.  Since Spanish coercion was continual,
it was only normal for the students to rebel.
Intuitively, they sensed the destruction of their way of
life.  Both school and church were suspect.

Priests, as instructors, read selections from the Bible,
religious treatises, and pamphlets.  There were no books for
the students.  With pencil, paper, and blackboard or
slate, children learned the rudiments of writing, reading,
and arithmetic.  Without musical accompaniment, they learned
hymns and poetry.  Their centuries were
centuries of neglect.
</p>

<p>
It was exceptional when an hacienda hired a priest-instructor
permanently.  Since teachers were either poorly
paid or were hacienda guests, they offered halfhearted
service.  Haciendas were known to neglect education
intentionally: the peasant was to be kept subordinate&mdash;a
little reading, a little writing, but no more.

Usually the main hacienda residence housed the school.  One
of the twenty or thirty rooms was designated the classroom.
It was small and had few or no windows; the
open door let in light and air.  Students in the sixteenth
century sat on the floor.  Later, they had benches and sat
around a table, the <i>maestro</i> at one end.  Slates came
into being in the eighteenth century; and, in the
nineteenth century, blackboards.  Engravings of the
presidents began to decorate bare walls.  Dirty, foxed maps hid
stains.  Tiled floors were often cold and damp.  Though there
was sunshine most of the year, classes were never held
under the laurel or palm trees.
</p>

<p>
Girls sat on one side, boys on the other&mdash;if the room was
large enough.  There were no sanitary facilities, no health
precautions, no hygiene instruction.  At recess, the
children drank from the patio fountain or cattle trough.

On an hacienda employing four hundred workers, about twenty
children attended school.  Since the hacienda was on a
dawn-to-dark
schedule, work never ran out; the average hacendado felt he
could employ those skinny legs and arms to his advantage.
At harvest time there were no classes; during
fiestas there were no classes; if the <i>maestro</i> got drunk
there were no classes.  Truancy was a fact of life.

At school and at home the children played marbles, using
clay marbles of their own baking.  They spun tops and played
jacks, tag, hide-and-seek, and a flower game
called "Stealing a Soul."  In "The Old Saints," the "buyer"
dashed from one saint to another to see if his saint is the
one he wants to buy.  If the saint runs off and is
caught he is given a "job" to do.

A favorite song was "Golden Bell":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Little golden bell,<br />
  Let me pass;<br />
  With all my children<br />
  Who are behind me.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Singing "La Víbora del Mar," the children divided into two
groups; this was a tug-of-war song and is still remembered:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>The serpent,<br />
  serpent of the sea,<br />
  here it can pass by.<br />
  Those in front run fast,<br />
  those in back will be left<br />
  behind;<br />
  a Mexican girl, selling fruit,<br />
  plums, apricots, muskmelons,<br />
  and watermelons.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Haciendas had no school libraries.  The <i>casa principal</i> may
have acquired a collection of history, travel, philosophy,
and fiction; but such collections were rarely
shared.  For centuries the Inquisition influenced most
reading habits.  Pagan and Catholic superstition wreaked
havoc with young minds; it is still evident in rural Mexico
where men and women knock on the side of a coffin&mdash;and
listen for an answer.  Men and women flagellate themselves.
Tarahumaras, in caves of the Barranca del
Cobre country, worship stone idols and pray to rain gods.
Lacandones still leave offerings on jungle altars.
</p>

<p>
Until about 1826, when a national school system was created
in the larger towns and in the cities, textbooks were
unknown except at private schools.  Homer,
Sappho, Plato, Shakespeare and Kant were all but
unrecognized.  <i>Don Quixote</i>, however, was an influence.  So
were Lope de Vega and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.
But they were only literary shadows.  No hacienda <i>maestro</i>
explored the thoughts of Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, or
Jefferson.  There were no science labs.  There was
no art instruction.
</p>

<p>
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries only six or
eight Mexican minds contributed to culture and learning:
Ruiz de Alarcón, Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora,
and Don Bartolomé de Alba were among them.  Their influence
was restricted to metropolitan centers.  Without books, with
limited transportation, the hacienda
remained a lost society.

In 1910, when there were approximately eight thousand
haciendas, between ten and twenty students attended school
each day on a given hacienda: In all, some 870,000 children
and teenagers were enrolled&mdash;gaining a rudimentary education.
In towns and cities, where private schools
contributed to the nation's education, schools were small
and offered limited opportunities.  With a population in
1910 of 15 million, Mexico's enrollment was among
the world's lowest.  Mexico had only 3 million literates.  In
all hacienda areas millions could not read or write&mdash;or
speak Spanish.

During the more than ten years of civil war and machete
madness that followed 1910-1914, education of the masses
was disrupted throughout the nation.  School
attendance dropped in towns and cities; on the hacienda
every hint of learning stopped.  When hacienda after
hacienda was pillaged or burned, the skeletal school
system disappeared.  Books&mdash;those there were&mdash;went up in flames.
Youth had no chance for scholastic growth.  The young who
survived were fortunate.  During these
years,
Mexico's population declined by one million people.

Years of revolution retarded Mexico to an incalculable
degree as guns took the place of brains.  Towns, while
occupied by troops or harassed by gunfire, had to
abandon teaching and schooling.  Youngsters born on an
hacienda during those years grew up without seeing the
inside of a school.
</p>

<p>
Yet, it is an amazing and stimulating fact that Mexico,
after such havoc, could evolve an educational system of
merit and induce the young and the old to attend classes.
The "Each One, Teach One," or "Analfabetismo Program," was
put into effect and successfully carried out.  In 1951,
thirty-seven years after the haciendas had been
abolished, the government appropriated 355,680,000 pesos
for schools.  Prefabs sprang up overnight; old buildings
were renovated; education became compulsory;
efforts were made to attract teachers and to train them.
</p>

<p>
The wealthy elite sons and daughters of the hacienda
studied at institutions of higher learning abroad.  This
favored group, though small, contributed to the nation's
maturity.  Universities such as Salamanca, Heidelberg,
Harvard, the Sorbonne, Oxford, and Cambridge enriched these
students.  They assumed important posts,
government positions, and engineering jobs; they became
senators, doctors, lawyers, and educators.  The long, bitter
struggle to attain a middle class had begun.

John Reed, an American journalist who covered the campaign
of Pancho Villa, described in <i>Insurgent Mexico</i> the
revolution at an hacienda in northern Mexico in
1913-1914:
</p>

<p class="quote">
We crept close to the line and when we were almost upon
them we opened fire.  There were three detachments and we
pushed right into their encampment and set fire to their
shelters.  Their corn and beans were laid out on blankets to
dry in the sun and we even destroyed that.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Carrancistas fled from us and we chased them through
very rough country.  We believed we were winning, but man!
It wasn't that way at all!  We followed them without
knowing where we were going.  They stopped on the other side
of a hill, at the entrance to Hacienda San Gregorio, and
there a fourth detachment withstood us so we pulled back
and joined our forces.  There were five thousand of us but
we were extended from San Gregorio to Topilejo.  Our guides
were local peasants and they sent General Chon and his
men through the mountains.  He was from Guerrero and he
didn't know these mountains so they sent him to the worst
peaks.  His men were stopped
but we weren't.  We were sent along the side of the highway
and General Teodor's men went on the highway because they
were all on horseback.  The Carrancistas had artillery but
the shots passed over us because we lay down in the
ditches....
</p>

<p class="quote">
But then we entered a little cornfield in a valley where
the fighting was very bad.  The Zapatistas were on one hill
and the Carrancistas were on another and we were in the middle,
fighting hand to hand with other Carrancistas.  The two
armies got all mixed up, there in San Gregorio.  There was a
tremendous hail of bullets and the dead piled up like stones in a
milpa (small plot).  The man just next to me fell....  At
five o'clock a bullet got the Captain who had been
blaspheming the day before.  In the dark we didn't know who was a
Zapatista, who was a Carrancista.

The revolution swept from hacienda to hacienda, now the
Carrancistas attacking, now the Colorados, now the
Zapatistas, now the Villistas.  After four centuries of
constant bludgeoning by
the Spaniards the hacienda worker was settling his score:
This was his opportunity to reclaim the land that had been
stolen from him, not once but many times.

Reed continues, supplying intimate details:

Tomorrow we'll move in on the Hacienda Casasano.  You, José,
will set fire to the stable; turn out the horses and colts
first ... you know where the hayloft is so pour your two
cans of kerosene there.  You, Magaña, empty the chicken coop
just before it gets dark, chase the chickens into the gully;
we'll be waiting there.  The more noise you make the
better.  María, open the front door and then open the
kitchen door, just stroll through the house and open
doors....  Give us our signal from the kitchen.  We'll
move in just as soon
as we see your light ... pour inside and wreck the place.

don't hang on too long, remember the hacienda is going up
in flames.

Revolutionist Emiliano Zapata attempted to destroy the
haciendas in his home state of Morelos.  Other radical
leaders in other states worked to undermine the
hacienda system.  At any cost, the Zapatista/Villista wanted
no more of the Díaz policy.  In place of Díazism the
peasants wanted freedom, dignity, land, schools, and
food; to achieve these goals they would ravage the nation.
Men, women, and children, intent on smashing the hacienda
world, could no longer exist on tortillas and
water.  Singly and in hordes, they scavenged and ravaged.
Peasants who understood less than ten Spanish words found
themselves trying Spanish if it helped the
cause.

<p>
Raiders commandeered trains and boarded flat cars and
freight cars, perched on the roofs, clung to the ladders,
crowding the cowcatcher of the locomotive.  Soldados
(soldiers) sang their cockroach songs as the train rolled,
belts of ammunition across their shoulders and around their
waists.

Women and children trailed the fighting battalions.  Women
were determined to prove themselves as resourceful as the
men: They were out to avenge years of
maltreatment.  They robbed stores in towns and sacked
hacienda wardrobes.  They strutted in Parisian finery, wore
silk hosiery, and elegant shawls.  Women became
terrorists in some regions.
</p>

<p>
Thieves' markets cropped up in León, Querétaro, San Luis
Potosí, Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Morelia.  Women traded
silverware for food, a blouse, a shirt,
cigarettes.  They traded Sevreware for ammunition and shoes
for pistols.
</p>

<p>
The women dynamited bank vaults and shared the money&mdash;government
and counterfeit.  They rifled safes and destroyed
documents at haciendas&mdash;land grants, deeds,
notarizations.  They roared into a village, waving flimsy
flags, encountering dogs barking and howling.  They fired
their rifles and pistols; they caroused and conscripted
fighters.

The horde fought, retreated, lost, and fought again, seldom
aware of a victory.
</p>

<p>
When their dead piled up in cornfields and fields of maguey,
too numerous to bury, they left them to be eaten by coyotes,
dogs, buzzards.  They learned to live as much
life as possible between sunup and sundown.  They copulated
in the fields.  They promised one another fidelity, they
lost one another, they found someone else.
Children, born in the field, were bundled into rebozos and
lugged to the next encampment
</p>

<p>
Again and again, they robbed the government troops of
ammunition, rifles, revolvers, and machineguns.  It was
steal or quit fighting.  They perpetrated more and more
dangerous raids: They spied; they used a hot-air balloon;
they filtered through troop concentrations; they passed
themselves off as scouts; faithfully, they followed
Pancho Villa and his henchmen and they vulturized the dead
in the barrancas, on the haciendas, in the towns.
</p>

<p>
Without boots or shoes they continued their barefoot war
against the hacendados.  Armed with machetes, men stole into
enemy encampments and returned with guns.
Some of the fighters believed the words of Zapata: "It is
better to die on your feet than to live on your knees."
</p>

<p>
In their bravado, they carved initials and dates on trees,
on the leaves of the maguey, and on the doors of churches
and haciendas.  "Freedom!" they cried.
</p>

<p>
Huddled around campfires, in their hideaways, they sang:
"If I am to die tomorrow let them kill me right away."
</p>

<p>
By now many hacienda mansions had disappeared.  Weeds had
taken over farmland, irrigation systems no longer
functioned, wells had dried, mills had been
dismantled, and cattle had been driven away or killed and
eaten.  Former laborers had fled or had been conscripted,
jailed, or killed.  Prices had climbed 300 percent.

and fighting every governmental force he demanded "Land for
the Landless!," "Land and Water!," "Freedom for the People!"

Zapatismo meant business everywhere and at all times.  As
revolutionist, Zapata was a lean, moustached young man;
without more than rudimentary schooling, he led
his countrymen against the hacienda system.  He had promised
his father, whose property was stolen by an hacendado, that
he would recover it for him.  When his
home village of San Miguel Anonecuilco was appropriated,
Zapata fled to the mountains, hoping for support from the
peasantry.  In time he commanded several
thousand armed men.
</p>

<p>
Ideologically, the revolution was American- and European-inspired
since it was focused on freedom and equality.  The
goal of this conflict was in a major sense
Utopian.  But it lacked intellectual leadership: a Napoleon,
to serve as figurehead.  Under a single military leadership
the revolution might have been shortened,
saving thousands of lives.  Following the collapse of the
Porfirio Díaz regime, leaders tottered like dominos, and
local revolts involved years of quixotic terrorism.
</p>

<p>
Zapata, Villa, Madero, Carranza, Huerta, and Obregón
attempted to form a government or attempted to attain power
for the sake of power.  Greed and chicanery
took their toll.  Almost every community felt the impact as
governments failed.  The Church did its best to retain the
feudalism of the hacienda; hacendados, lobbying in
the capital, attempted to retain their old status.

Zapata and Villa joined forces briefly, because they sought
the same goal.  They met in Mexico City but could not reach
an accord or coordinate their military
"hordes."  While they held the capital under their control,
they dreamed of power, and yet it is doubtful whether
either man thought constructively of the future of the
nine million peasants remaining on the haciendas, earning
from nothing to thirty
cents a day.  Suspecting betrayal, both men returned to
their native regions.

Villa raided most of the northern states.  His armed forces
sometimes had an international character with a menagerie
of professional adventurers: Tom Mix, Pascual
Orozco, Óscar Creighton, Guiseppe Garibaldi, Tracy
Richardson, and Hector Worden, the first American
barnstormer to participate in armed hostilities.  Villa, as
military governor of Chihuahua, stripped the fourteen
haciendas of the Terrazas family, haciendas totaling 17
million acres.  His cronies hanged Terrazas until he
revealed where cash was concealed.
</p>

<p>
Both Villa and Zapata were known as "horse bandits"&mdash;through
robbery they financed their troops or buried their loot for
tomorrow.  Sonorans and Chihuahuans
winked at the <i>entierros</i> (loot) they concealed in Sierra
Madre caves.  Villa and Zapata commanded thousands&mdash;killed
thousands.
</p>

<p>
Reed, in his book <i>Insurgent Mexico</i>, describes the fighting
at the Hacienda Santa Clara:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Massed columns of the army halted and began to defile to
the left and right, thin lines of troops jogging out under
the checkered sun and shade of great trees, until six thousand
men were spread in one single front ... Bugles blared
faintly far and near and the army moved forward in a mighty
line....  In the center, came the cannon car; beside that Villa rode
with his staff....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From Reed's reports, we learn that haciendas were
headquarters for insurgents.  Men were stationed at the
Hacienda la Cadena: Maderistas slept on the tiled floor of
the patio, saddles, bridles, sabers, rifles, and ammunition
against the wall, dirty blanket rolls in a corner.
</p>

<p>
Reed writes:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Sheep were baaing to be let out of the corral; little knots
of peons were gathered in front of the hacienda, pointing.
A little running horse appeared on the rim, headed our way.  He
was going at a furious speed, dipping and rising over the
rolling land.  As he spurred wildly up the little hill,
where we stood, we saw a horror.
</p>

<p class="quote">
A fan-shaped cascade of blood poured from the front of him.
The lower part of his mouth was shot away.  He reined up
beside the Colonel and tried earnestly, terribly, to tell him
something; but nothing intelligible issued from the ruin.
Tears poured down the poor fellow's cheeks.  He gave a
hoarse cry and driving spurs deep into his horse, fled.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One after another, haciendas disappeared in flames or were
pillaged and left to rot into windowless, doorless,
roofless buildings.  Trainloads of connoisseur furniture
and irreplaceable antiques were sold or forsaken.  A squatter,
with no home of his own, claimed a room or two, patched the
roof, and blocked a doorway with
adobes.  Cattle were fed and watered in the patio.  Overnight,
abandoned mill and refinery machinery was stripped and sold.
The revolutionaries had stolen the
horses, the thoroughbreds, the mules, donkeys, oxen, and
cattle.  Phaetons, buggies, wagons, and cars had vanished.
Poverty moved in.

Villa was gunned down in his Dodge, on the road near
his Hacienda Canutillo, the estate given him as a political
bribe.

In the summer of 1938, President Lázaro Cárdenas wrote to
his American friend, William C. Townsend:
</p>

<p class="quote">
We are confident that the people and the government of the
United States will be able to grasp the fact that the
breaking up of the large estates is the main point in our national
program for improving the living conditions of the peasants
of Mexico.  The ideal of giving land to the masses was
written into the Constitution at the cost of much bloodshed and
my government is duty-bound to comply with that mandate.
All the holdings that are larger than what the Agrarian
Code permits are subject to distribution if there are peasants
nearby who do not have land to till.  Each landowner,
however, is permitted to retain 370 acres, whether he is a
foreigner or a Mexican.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By 1940, approximately 45 million acres of hacienda land
had been turned over to the homeless and the landless by
President Cárdenas (1934-1940).  Three hundred
haciendas in the country could claim more than 1 million
acres apiece, and then only for a brief period.

The revolution had achieved an important goal.  Men and
women were free to live in a more congenial environment:
<i>Rurales</i> (police) would no longer pursue them.
The four-century-old illusion of a <i>patrón</i> (master) had
vanished; in its place the workers found themselves
unshackled.  They were hungry but no longer whipped.
Mexico began to say goodbye to the culture of poverty.
</p>

<p>
President Cárdenas, traveling from village to village, from
hacienda to hacienda, crisscrossing his country throughout
his term in office, listened to the little man, and the
little man believed what the <i>presidente</i> said, as he
promised roads, bridges, schools, clinics, water, and land.
Millions of peasants thanked him for a home and
independence.

By expropriating multi-billion dollar oil properties from
foreign companies, Cárdenas returned to Mexico some of its
lost pride and a hope for the future.  Although
agrarian reform came first on the nation's docket, there
were other reforms to help man improve his
lot.  The ejidal bank aided the farmer by loaning him money
for his plow, seeds, fertilizer, harvesting tools, oxen,
mules, tractors.

By 1960, the last of the largest haciendas had been
abolished: the Greene Cananea Ranch and the Hacienda
Atotonilco had become agrarian property&mdash;millions of
acres had returned to the people.
</p>

<p>
Mexico had become a Spanish-speaking nation.  Out of a
population of forty million people, only two million were
now unable to speak Spanish.  By 1960, a school
teacher earned 36,000 pesos a year, instead of 400 pesos
annually at an hacienda.

By the 1970s, about 70 percent of the children were
attending primary grades, while at the turn of the century,
in pre-revolutionary decades, scarcely 10 percent
acquired an elementary education.  By 1980, rural schools
provided at least two grades, and cities offered the
primary cycle through the sixth year.  Ideally, a child can
now attend school at five years of age, learn through six
years of primary, three years of secondary, two years of
preparatory, followed by three to seven years at the
university level.

Article 3 of the new constitution prescribes that education,
whether in national, state, or municipal institutions,
should develop all the faculties, encourage patriotism and
an awareness of international solidarity, shun religious
dogma, advance science, and oppose fanaticism and slavery.
</p>

<p>
This progress was based on a past that combined two
distinct traditions.  Mexico's pre-Columbian culture had
mastered concepts of intellectual and practical value,
had a knowledge of astronomy, a number system, metropolitan
and temple architecture, and made advances in writing,
surgery and medical skills, sculpture and mural
art, irrigation, and the construction of a system of
highways.
</p>

<p>
The other tradition was based on the methods and knowledge
that the sixteenth-century Iberian brought Mexico: the
wheel, sophisticated tools, steel, industrial know-how,
marine architecture, navigational skills, and
gunpowder.  But the Conquistadors also destroyed much.
Although many of the pre-Columbian societies were
warlike, the Monte Albán temples in the state of Oaxaca
appear to represent a local culture that had fostered peace
for some fifteen hundred years.  The Iberian
invaders were not familiar with such ancient traditions and
often failed to appreciate their values.  They destroyed
towns and cities, burned books, disrupted the
ecology, spread disease, and diminished the arts, crafts,
and culture of the new world.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the twentieth century that Mexico came to
the forefront internationally.  Respect for the country grew
as Mexico undertook to restore its pre-Columbian
sites, assembled comprehensive anthropological collections,
and established a University City and a dynamic, original
metropolitan architecture.  Famous artists
contributed to this period of awakened cultural awareness:
Roberto Montenegro, Covarrubias, Orozco, Rivera, O'Higgins,
Tamayo, and Siqueiros.  A folkloric ballet,
a national symphony, and entertainers like Conchita Cintrón,
Dolores del Río, and Cantinflas broadened the cultural
landscape.
</p>

<p>
Among contemporary writers, Luis Spota, Carlos Fuentes,
Sergio Galino, Luisa Hernández, Augustín Yañez, Octavio Paz,
and Antonio Haas have interpreted Mexico
for a large public.  Leopoldo Zea and Ramón Xirau have added
to Mexico's philosophical thought.  Silvio Zavala has
contributed to Mexican history.
</p>

<p>
The radio and television media are following American
footsteps&mdash;eager to keep pace.  There is no hacienda
nostalgia in Mexico&mdash;only frenetic pressure for
industrialization and overall capitalism.  Most renowned
haciendas are only memories: they are <i>cascos</i>, <i>recuerdos</i>.

The 1529 Hacienda San Gabriel de Las Palmas, in Morelos,
has become an American luxury residence; other mansions house
millionaires; still others have become motels, dairies,
factories, schools, posh restaurants, subdivisions with an
hacienda office.  But hundreds of hacienda homes have
been totally abandoned.  They are piles of rubble&mdash;no more
than place-names.
</p>

<p>
In the struggle to eliminate the hacienda system, more than
eight hundred thousand men, women, and children died.
</p>

<p>
Forces that held together a dubious past seek to achieve an
enlightened future.  Education continues to enrich more and
more lives.  Mexico's present-day inflation and
political corruption have halted the country's advance, but
these unfortunate conditions cannot last.

<h3>
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
</h3>

<p>
Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909-1990) was both a writer and
an artist, born in Moberly, Missouri,
and educated at Oberlin College, the University of Arizona,
the Academia de San Carlos in
Mexico City, and the Instituto de Bellas Artes in
Guadalajara.  His work can be divided into three
categories: He is the author of many novels, short stories,
and poems; second, as a fine artist, his
drawings, hacienda illustrations, and paintings have been
exhibited in more than 40 one-man
shows in leading galleries, including the Los Angeles
County Museum, the Atlanta Art
Museum, the Bancroft Library, the Richmond Art Institute,
the Brooks Museum, the
Instituto-Mexicano-Norteamericano in Mexico City, and other
galleries; and, third, he devoted
much of his life to the most comprehensive study of the
haciendas of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Three hundred and fifty of his pen-and-ink illustrations of
the haciendas and more than one
thousand hacienda photographs make up the Paul Alexander
Bartlett Collection held by the
Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection of the
University of Texas, and form part of a
second diversified collection held by the American Heritage
Center of the University of
Wyoming, which also includes an extensive archive of
Bartlett's literary work, fine art, and letters.
A third archive consisting primarily of Bartlett's literary
work is held by the Department of
Special Collections at UCLA.
A fourth archive consisting of 198 hacienda photographs
by Bartlett is preserved by the Latin America Image Library
at Tulane University in New Orleans.
</p>

<p>
Bartlett's book about the
history and life on the haciendas,
including a selection of his illustrations and photographs,
was originally published by the
University Press of Colorado in 1990 under the title <i>The
Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist's Record</i>.
</p>

<p>
Paul Alexander Bartlett's fiction has been commended by
many authors, among them Pearl
Buck, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James Michener,
Upton Sinclair, Evelyn Eaton, and
many others.  He was the recipient of numerous grants,
awards, and fellowships, from such
organizations such as the Leopold Schepp Foundation, the
Edward MacDowell Association, the
New School for Social Research, the Huntington Hartford
Foundation, the Montalvo
Foundation, Yaddo, and the Carnegie Foundation.  His novel
<i>When the Owl Cries</i> received
national acclaim; his fine art has been exhibited
throughout the United States and in Mexico; his
poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals and
anthologies and has been published in
individual volumes of his collected poetry.  Bartlett was
extremely prolific and left to the
archives of his work many as yet unpublished manuscripts,
including poetry, short stories,
and novels, as well as more than a thousand paintings and
illustrations.
</p>

<p>
His wife, Elizabeth Bartlett, a widely published and
internationally recognized poet, is the author
of seventeen published books of poetry, more than one
thousand individually published poems,
numerous short stories and essays in leading literary
quarterlies and anthologies, and, as the
founder of Literary Olympics, Inc., served as the editor of
a series of multi-language volumes of
international poetry to honor the work of outstanding
contemporary poets.
</p>

<p>
His son, Steven James Bartlett, has published fifteen books
and many papers in philosophy
and psychology.
